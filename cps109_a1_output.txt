In the case where there are no issues, the following lines will be output to the terminal:

    File: a1_inputDNA.txt read successfully
    DNA transcribed successfully
    File Writing to 'RNAOutput.txt' successful
    RNA translated successfully
    File Writing to 'ProteinOutput.txt' successful

    DNA transcribed and translated in 0.0307 seconds.
    Please check RNAOutput.txt and ProteinOutput.txt for your respective RNA and Protein outputs


If the program is run with an incorrect file name, it will raise a FileNotFoundError:
    FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'a_inputDNA.txt'


In the case where there is no stop codon, the following message will be printed to the terminal, but the program continues to run: 
    No stop codon found, improper protein may be synthesized incorrectly

Without a start codon, the following exception message will be reaised and the program will stop:
    Exception: Translation cannot occur
